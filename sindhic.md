# Sindhic languages

Not sure if any comparative Sindhic-family works exist, would be nice to have! Also need to add works on Vracada Apabhramsa.

## Sindhi

These are the most comprehensive resources, but a little outdated:

* Ernst Trumpp (1872). *[Grammar of the Sindhi Language: Compared with the Sanskrit-Prakrit and the Cognate Indian Vernaculars](https://archive.org/details/grammarsindhila01trumgoog)*.
* Parmanand Mewaram (1910). *[A Sindhi-English Dictionary](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/mewaram/)*.
* Sindhi Language Authority. *[Online Sindhi Dictionaries](http://dic.sindhila.edu.pk/index.php)*.

Some dialectal studies of more recent times also exist:

* Murlidhar Kishinchand Jetley (1964). *[Morphology of Sindhi: A Descriptive Analysis of Vicoli, the Standard Sindhi Dialect](https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/169640)*.
* Murli D. Bhawnani. *[Descriptive analysis of Thari: A dialect of Sindhi language](https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/145755)*.
* Sibasis Mukherjee. *[Phonology and morphology of Jadeja dialect of Sindhi](https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/173289)*.

## Kacchi

* S. M. Katre (1966). *[Descriptive analysis of Kachi (Kacchi)](http://lib.unipune.ac.in:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/5330)*.

## Khetrani

* Ali H. Birmania, Fasih Ahmed (2017). *[Language of the Khetrans of Barkhan of Pakistani Balochistan: A preliminary description](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384116302236?via%3Dihub)*.

## Kholosi

* Erik Anonby, Hassan Mohebbi Bahmani (2013). *[Shipwrecked and landlocked: Kholosi, an Indo-Aryan language in south-west Iran](https://www.academia.edu/30800968/Shipwrecked_and_landlocked_Kholosi_an_Indo_Aryan_language_in_south_west_Iran)*.
* Tahereh Rezaei (2020). *[First notes on the syntax of Kholosi as a heritage language in the south of Iran](https://microcontact.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/210/2020/01/HLS1-Rezaei.pdf)*.
